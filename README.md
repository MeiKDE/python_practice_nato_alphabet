# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Project

This Python project demonstrates how to use the `pandas` library for handling dictionaries and data frames, and how to create a phonetic alphabet dictionary using a CSV file. The project includes examples of iterating through dictionaries and data frames, as well as using dictionary comprehension to convert data into a specific format.

## Project Structure

- **student_dict**: A dictionary containing students' names and their scores.
- **student_data_frame**: A data frame created from `student_dict` to demonstrate row-wise iteration.
- **phonetic_dict**: A dictionary created from a CSV file of the NATO phonetic alphabet, mapping letters to their corresponding code words.
